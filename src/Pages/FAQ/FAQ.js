            Visit the course catalog to browse our offerings. In addition to searching by course duration and availability, you can also search by subject to ensure you find a course that reflects your interests. Though it is not required, we encourage those who have not studied art before to consider taking an art history course first to get a solid grounding in the discipline before exploring more specific disciplines. Our art history courses are the perfect first step before moving on to art market courses.

            There are no prerequisites. Our courses are open to students of all backgrounds who are 18 years of age and older.
All courses are conducted in English. Video lectures include English subtitles and the option to slow-down, pause, or replay lectures for better retention. Discussion boards are a critical component of each of our courses; therefore, we suggest students have a conversational knowledge of English when pursuing a Certificate of Completion. For any of the art writing courses, students need to be 100% proficient in written English.
